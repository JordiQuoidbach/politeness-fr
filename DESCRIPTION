Description: French-language adaptation of the politeness package for detecting markers of politeness in French natural language. This package extends the original English politeness package with French-specific features including tutoiement/vouvoiement, imparfait de politesse, and conditionnel de politesse. The original package was created by Yeomans, Kantor, and Tingley (2018). This adaptation allows researchers to easily visualize and quantify politeness between groups of French documents.
